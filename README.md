Project Title : Building a Speech-to-Text System with
Integrated Language Modeling for Improved
Accuracy in Transcription Services
# ivr
Noise-Robust Speech-to-Text Transcription System for IVR/Call Center Automation using Wav2Vec2 and real-world noise augmentation.
**ðŸ”‘ Key Features**

âœ… Noise-Robust Transcription: Simulates noisy call center environments using real-world background audio.

âœ… Preprocessing Pipeline: Adds configurable background noise at various SNR levels to clean IVR prompts.

âœ… Speech-to-Text Inference: Uses pretrained Wav2Vec2 models from HuggingFace for accurate transcription.

âœ… Evaluation with WER: Measures transcription quality using Word Error Rate (WER) via the jiwer library.

âœ… Domain-Specific Focus: Designed for IVR use cases like customer service automation and call routing.

âœ… Visualization Support: Includes waveform and spectrogram plots to explore audio characteristics.

âœ… Modular Code: Separated scripts for preprocessing, inference, evaluation, and EDA.
